This repository helps couples fairly manage shared expenses using CSV files and GitHub Actions.

Features:
- Contributions to the shared bank account can be entered in a csv file
- Virtual contributions: To offset an agreed upon contributions gap, partner A can enter -123 and person B 123 as a virtual payment to the shared bank account. This would ensure that the calculated balance does not consider this agreed payment gap of $123 of partner B.
- Paid sums can be entered into another csv file
- The report script generates a report and shows how much each partner overpaid/underpaid. This is based on the assumptions that all payments were made from the shared bank account and that each partner is paying into it.

## üìÇ Structure

- [`data/`](data/) ‚Äî Monthly raw CSV data files
- [`reports/`](reports/) ‚Äî Auto-generated reports
- [`expense_tracker/`](scripts/) ‚Äî Report-generation logic and cli tool
- [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) ‚Äî GitHub Actions

## üì§ How It Works

With Github Actions (runs fully on Github, you can edit your csvs there; no local Python setup needed):
1. Fork this repo
2. Add your monthly expenses to `data/YYYY-MM.csv`
3. Add your monthly contributions to `data/YYYY-MM-contributions.csv`
4. Commit
5. GitHub Actions runs `./expense_tracker.sh report`, just wait a minute for it to complete
6. The report appears in `reports/YYYY-MM-report.md`

Locally:
1. Clone this repo
2. $ poetry install
3. Add your monthly expenses to `data/YYYY-MM.csv` or run `./expense_tracker.sh add-expense --paid-by Bob --amount 42 --notes "Weekly shopping"`
4. Add your monthly contributions to `data/YYYY-MM-contributions.csv` or run `./expense_tracker.sh add-contribution --name Alice --amount 100 --notes "Monthly deposit"`
5. Run `./expense_tracker.sh report`
6. The report appears in `reports/YYYY-MM-report.md`

## üöÄ Command Line Usage

You can record expenses and contributions easily from the command line:

```sh
./expense_tracker.sh add-expense --date 2025-07-01 --category Groceries --paid-by Alice --amount 42.50 --notes "Weekly shopping"

./expense_tracker.sh add-contribution --date 2025-07-01 --name Bob --amount 1000 --notes "Monthly deposit"
```

This will append to the appropriate CSV files in the `data/` directory.

To trigger report generation on the command line, run
```sh
./expense_tracker.sh report
```

## What to do when..

- you used money from the shared account for a personal purpose: Add a negative contribution
```csv
Date,Name,Amount,Virtual Contribution,Notes
2025-06-01,Alice,-100,No,Accidental withdrawal for ..
```
- you paid something for your partner from your private account that served only them: This is not considered as relevant for the shared account -- ask to be repaid directly. Alternatively, add a negative contribution for your partner
```csv
Date,Name,Amount,Virtual Contribution,Notes
2025-06-01,Bob,-100,No,Alice bought you ..
```
- something you bought together served your partner more than you: In addition to the expense, also add a negative contribution for your partner if you must, with the fraction of the expense you would like back
